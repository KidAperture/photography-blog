Lost in Suburbia is a photography blog chronicling the quiet apocalypse of everyday life, where lawn ornaments rot in the sun and strip malls stare blankly into the void. Shot in a street photography style with occasional detours into landscape and portraiture (because even despair needs variety), these photos capture moments that whisper “This is fine” while everything smolders beneath the surface.
